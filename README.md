1. Who was the client and what did they want?

The client was The Gaming Room, a company that wanted to expand their Android game, Draw It or Lose It, into a scalable web-based application. They needed a system that could support multiple teams and players across platforms while ensuring unique names and maintaining only one instance of the game service at a time.

2. What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I did well connecting technical decisions directly to the client’s needs. I clearly explained platform recommendations and design choices, such as using the Singleton pattern to enforce a single game service instance.

3. What about working through a design document was helpful?

Creating the design document before coding helped me think through system architecture, constraints, and scalability early. This made implementation more organized and intentional.

4. What would you revise or improve?

I would expand more on security considerations and future scalability, especially around authentication and data protection.

5. How did you interpret and implement user needs?

I focused on both the business goals and technical requirements, translating them into object-oriented design decisions and structured system components. Considering user needs is essential because software must solve real problems, not just function correctly.

6. How did you approach designing the software? What would you use in the future?

I used object-oriented principles, UML modeling, and design pattern analysis. In the future, I would continue using structured documentation and incorporate earlier stakeholder feedback to refine requirements before finalizing the design.
